# Toy Robot

A Java application which simulates the behaviour of a toy robot on a 5 units x 5 units table top, which abides by specified commands. The simulated commands enable the toy robot to MOVE (forward), (turn) RIGHT, (turn) LEFT and REPORT (its coordinates and orientation). The toy robot is prevented from falling off the table and disregards unspecified commands.
